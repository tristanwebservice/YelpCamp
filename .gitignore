# Environment Variables / Sensitive Data
.env                    # Critical! Stores your database connection string,
                        # API keys, secret session keys, etc. DO NOT COMMIT!

# MongoDB related (if you have local DB files or logs)
# You generally don't commit MongoDB data files if running locally
# If your app creates specific MongoDB log files, add them here
# For Mongoose, there's usually nothing specific to ignore unless you manually
# create local test databases or dumps.
db_data/                # Example: If you manually store MongoDB data files here
data/db/                # Common location for MongoDB's default data directory

# Log files

# Build artifacts / Temporary files (if you have front-end build processes)
dist/                   # Common for compiled/transpiled front-end assets
